## Overview 

This is a repo with the codes to extract real estate data of Belgium from two websites. 
The codes are developed differently depending on the the structure websites being scraped. 
The two websites are The collected data is in the corresponding .csv files

## Contents 

These datasets contain the following information: 

• Locality 

• Type of property (House/apartment)

## Workplan 

We approached the project with a pragmatic mindset, to each collect datasets from different websites, and help each other build the different codes to be able to do so effectively.


## Challenges: 

Finding websites to get information from. We encountered either being blocked or captcha measures that prevented us from getting any data from some of the websites. 
Building the code was also that worked was also quite challenging, and a lot of lessons in the best tools to use were learned along the way. Scrapping is also an 
activity that showed itself to need time, which we had not anticipated.


### Pending things to do

Finish collecting the data

Merge the datasets, and assign appropriate values for all fields
